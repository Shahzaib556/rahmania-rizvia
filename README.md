# Jamia Rahmania Rizvia Sohawa — Management System

A Django-based management system for Jamia Rahmania Rizvia Sohawa (Sohawa, Jhelum — founded 1988 by
Hazrat Allama Qari Abdullah Sialvi) with role-based logins, a live dashboard, and modules for students,
teachers, classes/sections/subjects, attendance, exams & result cards, Quran progress (Sabaq / Sabqi /
Manzil), timetable, homework, library, inventory, certificates, fees, donations and notices/events.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python 3 + Django 6
- Database: SQLite by default (zero setup) — switchable to MySQL via `.env`
- Frontend: Bootstrap 5, Chart.js, Font Awesome (navy & gold theme)
- Auth: Django's built-in auth with a custom `User` model and 9 roles (Super Admin, Principal,
  Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Accountant, Librarian, Staff)

## New modules (added in this version)
- **Exams & Results** — create exams per class, enter marks per section/subject (teachers only for their
  own sections/subjects), result sheet with positions, printable **Result Card** (grade, pass/fail,
  class position). Results become visible to students/parents only after you tick *Published*.
  Grading: A+ ≥90, A ≥80, B ≥70, C ≥60, D ≥50, E ≥40, F <40 (pass mark 40% — change `PASS_PERCENT` in `exams/models.py`).
- **Quran Progress (Hifz)** — daily Sabaq / Sabqi / Manzil records per student (para 1–30, portion,
  performance). Class teachers record for their own sections; students/parents see it in the portal.
- **Timetable** — weekly grid per section (any days, so Friday-off weeks work), teacher clash detection,
  "My Schedule" for teachers, read-only view for students/parents.
- **Homework** — teachers assign homework (with optional file) to their sections; students/parents see their own section's.
- **Library** — books catalogue, issue/return to students or teachers, availability tracking, overdue fine (Rs 5/day — `FINE_PER_DAY` in `library/models.py`). Librarian role supported.
- **Inventory** — items with stock in/out history and low-stock warnings.
- **Certificates** — Character, Leaving, Hifz-e-Quran completion, Nazra completion and Merit certificates with auto serial numbers and a print-ready A4 page.
- **Website contact form** now saves messages (Admin → Sitepages → Contact messages); dashboard shows unread count.
- **Reports & Export** also covers Exam Results, Quran Progress, Inventory and Library (CSV/PDF).
- Public site rebranded for the Jamia, with Urdu name, WhatsApp / Facebook / website links, founder and establishment year — all editable in Admin → Site Settings.

## What's included (original modules)
- **Public website** (no login required): Home, About, Services, Contact — navy & gold themed,
  describes the school, and the About/Contact pages show live contact info, a Facebook link, and
  **bank account details for donations** (Zakat, Sadqa, etc.) — all editable from
  `/admin/ → Sitepages → Site Settings` without touching code.
- **Reports & Export**: any Management/Finance/Teacher user can go to **Reports & Export** in the
  sidebar, pick a data type (Students, Attendance, Fee Payments, Income & Funding, Expenses), an
  optional date range, and download it as **CSV or PDF** — filtered exactly to that range.
- **Income & Funding module**: records donations and religious giving — who gave it (donor name),
  the type (**Zakat, Sadqa, Sadqa-e-Fitar, Ushar, Fee, General Donation, Other**), amount, date,
  and contact info. Shows on the dashboard alongside fee income, and feeds into the monthly
  profit calculation (Fee income + Donations − Expenses).
- Custom role-based `User` model + login/logout/profile/change-password
- **Role-based access, enforced on the backend (not just hidden in the UI)**:
  - **Super Admin / Principal / Admin** — full access to every module.
  - **Accountant** — dashboard + fee structures/payments/expenses; no student/teacher/attendance management.
  - **Teacher** — can view students and mark attendance **only for the sections where they're the assigned
    class teacher**; cannot manage other teachers, academic setup, or fees.
  - **Student** — logs into a dedicated **read-only portal**: own profile, own attendance history, own fee
    status, notices/events aimed at students. Cannot mark attendance or edit anything.
  - **Parent** — same read-only portal, scoped to their linked children (linked via the admin panel).
  - Every list/create/update/delete view checks the logged-in user's role server-side
    (`accounts/mixins.py::RoleRequiredMixin`), and the sidebar only shows links a role can actually use.
- Dashboard with live stats (students, teachers, classes, attendance %, fee collection, pending
  fees, expenses, profit) and Chart.js line/pie charts (staff roles only)
- Students: registration, search, filter by status, detail profile, edit, delete
- Teachers: add (creates linked user account), profile, edit, delete
- Academic structure: Academic Years, Classes, Sections (with class teacher), Subjects
- Attendance: mark daily attendance per section (teacher's own sections only), attendance report/history
- Fees: fee structures per class, fee collection with auto receipt numbers and balance
  calculation, donation/income tracking (Zakat, Sadqa, Sadqa-e-Fitar, Ushar, Fee, Other), and
  expense tracking
- Notices & Events: notice board with audience targeting and pinning (auto-filtered per role), event calendar
- Django Admin panel enabled for every model (superuser has full access)
- Seed script with sample data (40 students, 4 teachers, Nazra/Hifz/Tajweed/Dars-e-Nizami classes, fee/attendance
  history, a notice, an event, and one sample login per role for testing)

## Tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Getting started

```bash
cd jamia_rahmania_rizvia
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # edit if needed
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py shell < seed.py     # optional: creates sample data + admin login
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit **http://127.0.0.1:8000/** — you'll be redirected to the login page.

### Default logins (created by `seed.py`)
| Role       | Username     | Password    | What they see |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Admin      | admin        | admin123    | Everything |
| Teacher    | teacher1     | changeme123 | Their own sections' students + attendance marking |
| Student    | student1     | changeme123 | Read-only: own attendance, fees, notices |
| Parent     | parent1      | changeme123 | Read-only: linked child's attendance & fees |
| Accountant | accountant1  | changeme123 | Fee structures, payments, expenses |

Bank/donation details are **not** pre-filled — enter the real account in `/admin/ → Sitepages → Site Settings`.
Change these passwords immediately in production. Visit `/` for the public website — the login link is in
the top-right of the navbar.

If you skip the seed script, create your own admin with:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Switching to MySQL

1. Install MySQL server and create a database, e.g. `jamia_rahmania_rizvia`.
2. In `.env`, set:
   ```
   DB_ENGINE=mysql
   DB_NAME=jamia_rahmania_rizvia
   DB_USER=your_mysql_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   ```
3. Make sure `mysqlclient` is installed (it's in `requirements.txt`; on Linux you may need
   `sudo apt install default-libmysqlclient-dev pkg-config build-essential` first).
4. Run `python manage.py migrate` again against the MySQL database.

## Roles & permissions
Every view requires login (`@login_required` / `LoginRequiredMixin`). The `User.role` field and
`accounts/decorators.py::role_required` give you a starting point for restricting specific views
to specific roles (e.g. only Accountants can collect fees) — wire this up per-view as your
policies require. Django's admin panel already has full role separation via Django's built-in
permission/group system, which you can assign per role from `/admin/`.

## Still not built
Teacher attendance and teacher leave have database models and Admin screens but no dedicated pages yet;
hostel/boarding, staff payroll and SMS/WhatsApp notifications are not included.

## Security notes
- CSRF protection is on by default (Django middleware + `{% csrf_token %}` in every form)
- Passwords are hashed by Django's auth system
- The custom user model uses role-based access; extend `role_required` to lock down views per
  role before deploying
- Set `DEBUG=False` and a strong random `SECRET_KEY` before deploying to production
